oronavirus disease 2019 <b>COVID-19</b>, also known as the coronavirus or COVID, is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
2 (SARS-CoV-2).The first known case was identified in <font size= 4 face ='Malgun Gothic' color=' fuchisa' > <abbr title= "Wuhan is the capital of Hubei 
Province in the People's Republic of China.">  Wuhan
</abbr></font>, China, in December 2019. The disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic.

ymptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste. Symptoms may
begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms. Of those people 
who develop noticeable symptoms enough to be classed as patients, most (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop 
severe symptoms (<font size= 4 face ='Malgun Gothic' color=' fuchisa' ><abbr title= "Shortness of breath (SOB), also known as dyspnea is a feeling of not

</font> , or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging), and 5% suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan
 dysfunction). Older people are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms. Some people continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID) for 
months after recovery, and damage to organs has been observed. Multi-year studies are currently underway to further investigate the long-term effects of
 the disease.

<br><font size= 6 face ='Malgun Gothic' color= ' indigo'>T </font><font size= 4 face ='Malgun Gothic' color= ' indigo'>
ransmission of COVID-19 occurs mainly when an infected person is in close contact with another person. Small droplets containing the virus can spread 
from an infected person's nose and mouth as they breathe, cough, sneeze, sing, or speak. Other people are infected if the virus gets into their mouth,
nose or eyes. Airborne transmission is also sometimes possible, as smaller infected droplets and particles can linger in the air for minutes to hours 
within enclosed spaces that have inadequate ventilation. Less commonly, the virus may spread via contaminated surfaces. People who are infected can 
transmit the virus to another person up to two days before they themselves show symptoms, as can people who do not experience symptoms. People remain 
infectious for up to ten days after the onset of symptoms in moderate cases and up to twenty days in severe cases.

<br><font size= 6 face ='Malgun Gothic' color= ' indigo'>S </font><font size= 4 face ='Malgun Gothic' color= ' indigo'>
everal testing methods have been developed to diagnose the disease. The standard diagnostic method is by detection of the virus' nucleic acid by
 <font size= 4 face ='Malgun Gothic' color=' fuchisa' ><abbr title= "real-TimeReverse ranscription Polymerase Chain Reaction"> rRT-PCR </abbr></font> ,
 <font size= 4 face ='Malgun Gothic' color=' fuchisa' ><abbr title= "Transcription-Mediated Amplification ">TMA </abbr> </font>, 
or by <font size= 4 face ='Malgun Gothic' color=' fuchisa' ><abbr title= "Reverse Transcription Loop-mediated isothermal AMPlification"> RT-LAMP </abbr>

<br><font size= 6 face ='Malgun Gothic' color= ' indigo'>P </font><font size= 4 face ='Malgun Gothic' color= ' indigo'>
reventive measures include physical or social distancing,
 <font size= 4 face ='Malgun Gothic' color=' fuchisa' ><abbr title= "A quarantine is a restriction on the movement of people, animals and goods
 which is intended to prevent the spread of disease or pests."> quarantining</abbr></font>, 
ventilation of indoor spaces, covering coughs and sneezes, hand washing, 
and keeping unwashed hands away from the face. The use of face masks or coverings has been recommended in public settings to minimize the risk of 
transmissions. 
<br>
<br><strong><mark style="background-color: lightsalmon;"> Maintain at least a 1-metre distance between yourself and others to reduce your risk of infections when they cough, sneeze or speak.
 Maintain an even greater distance between yourself and others when indoors. The further away, the better.
<br>
<br>Make wearing a mask a normal part of being around other people.</mark>

<br>Make wearing a mask a normal part of being around other people.
<br>
<br>The appropriate use, storage and cleaning or disposal are essential to make masks as effective as possible.
<br>
<br>Clean your hands before you put your mask on, as well as before and after you take it off, and after you touch it at any time.
<br>
<br>Make sure it covers both your nose, mouth and chin.<br>
<br>When you take off a mask, store it in a clean plastic bag, and everyday either wash it if it’s a fabric or dispose of a medical mask in a trash bin.<br>
       <br> Don’t use masks with valves.<br></mark>

Several vaccines have been developed and many countries have initiated mass vaccination campaigns.Although work is underway to develop drugs
 that inhibit the virus, the primary treatment is symptomatic. Management involves the treatment of symptoms, supportive care, isolation, and
 experimental measures.
